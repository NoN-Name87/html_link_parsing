# html_link_parsing
It's link parsing in html-code with regex. I hope you felt my pain when I wrote this reg expression.
Instructions:
1)Enter link(example:https://github.com/NoN-Name87)
2)The program will receive the html-code of the page with links and print list of sites(github.com or stackoverflow.com).
P.S. Don't ask why I did it
